I am a PhD student under Dr. DK Panda's <a href='http://nowlab.cse.ohio-state.edu/'>NOWLAB</a> at The Ohio State University. My research is focused on the intersection of deep learning frameworks and high performance computing. Specifically, my research focuses on resolving distributed deep learning training bottlenecks such as checkpointing, model/optimizer compression, and deep/machine learning framework co-design. I actively contribute to the MVAPICH2 project and its subprojects such as MVAPICH2-GDR (High Performance MPI for GPU clusters), and HiDL (High Performance Deep Learning).
